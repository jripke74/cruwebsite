    <h1>WHAT WE DO</h1>
    <p>Looking to move forward in your spiritual journey?  It helps to have a coach who can provide direction, training and encouragement along the way.  Cru exists to help you take the next step in your spiritual journey.  Sitting down with someone with experience who can help you discern where you are in your spiritual journey and where you want and need to grow, and help you navigate the road blocks is an investment that is certain to pay off in spiritual growth and maturity.</p>
    <p>We provide small groups and have personal appointments with people who are exploring what they believe and why.  We also provide a safe place to ask hard questions about life and God. We interact on topics such as defining success, finding peace in uncertainty, and discovering your lifeâ€™s purpose.</p>
    <p>In addition, we coach and disciple Christians to have a consistent walk with God and develop them to become spiritual leaders who influence others around them.  Let us help you take the next step!</p>
    <h2>Beginning Your Journey</h2>
